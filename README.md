Business Need:
Facebook groups such as Room of Requirements (RoR), female RoR and NYUAD Free & For Sale have
a lot of posts of students selling their items or promoting their businesses. However, there is no
centralized system as all the posts are scattered throughout the three groups and often overshadow more
important information. Furthermore, although people post requests of items required and similar products
are being sold, the buyer and the seller often do not have a chance to connect with each other. Such a
system can help link the buyer and the seller and be mutually beneficial.
 
Functionality:\
● Users can log in through SSO (or Google+).\
● Users can post items they wish to sell – for each item, they can fill out a description, e.g. size,\
quantity, condition, and general comments.\
● Users can post services they provide (including small on-campus businesses) as products.\
● Users can post about the sale of other NYU-AD specific products such as Falcon Dirhams or Campus Dirhams.\
● Users can search for products and services via keywords.\
● Users can also request items (e.g. “is anyone selling a white dress?”) and find sellers of the item.\
● Products and services on the website will be classified into multiple categories.\
● Products and services can be filtered based on price and the seller-listed attributes (for instance size, color, etc).\
● Users can choose to make their listing with a set price or via a bidding system.\
● Users can contact one another through a chat system (or via contact info listed on their profile).\
● Users can rate and view previous ratings of their experience with the buyer/seller.\
● Users can choose to sell anonymously [or potentially to a certain subsection of users] (since people often choose to post on a gender-specific RoR).\
● Users can choose to be notified of new postings.\

Expected Value:\
Tangible:\
● Increased visibility and sales by at least 10% for student-run small businesses on campus.\
● Reduce double posting (i.e. buyers and sellers of the same product making posts) by at least 30%.\

Intangible:\
● Centralized system → better user experience; easier trading.\
● Accountability for users in terms of buyers not showing up after committing to buy.\
● No spam posts on RoR / female RoR.\
● Bidding system to allow fairer pricing.\

Special Issues or Constraints:\
Special Issues:\
● Each user is both a seller and a buyer.\
● No feasible way to verify items posted.\
● Logging in through SSO requires authorization from NYU-AD.\
Time Constraints:\
● System must be delivered within the next 3 months.\
Technical Constraints:\
● System requires a large database to handle the high volume of users.\
● System must work cross-platform, since every user has a different set of devices.\
